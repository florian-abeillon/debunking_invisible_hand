## General Introduction

Coding project for ETH Zürich's course *[Agent-Based Modeling and Social System Simulation](https://coss.ethz.ch/education/ABM.html)*.  
The main idea is to simulate independent selling/buying agents, and observe the evolution of price with different parameters -- testing validity of the *Invisible Hand* theory.  

-> ABSTRACT HERE <-

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
